            <p><h3>Hey, I am Aigul.</h3> 
                <dl>
                <dt>I have started my JS learning journey 2 months ago with Code The Dream School.</dt> 
                    <dd>  This will be my first step in building my portfolio in Web Development, as a portfolio is also as 
                        important as a resume itself. A portfolio is our second online presence and 
                        can easily tell people about what kind of person you are and what kind of thing you do. </dd>
                <dt>Summary </dt>
                    <dd>I have years of experience in FMCG companies with expertise in supply network operation, marketing, 
                        communications and portfolio management.</dd>
